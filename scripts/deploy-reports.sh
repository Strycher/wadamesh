#!/usr/bin/env bash
# wadamesh report service deploy: install/refresh the beta test-report service
# (deploy/report-service.py) on the firmware VPS, behind the existing
# firmware.wadamesh.com vhost at /report/.
#
# What it does, all of it idempotent:
#   * rsyncs the service into /opt/wadamesh-reports
#   * checks flask + requests are importable by the system python
#   * installs the systemd unit, enables and restarts it
#   * refreshes the firmware vhost (which now proxies /report/) and reloads nginx
#
# The SQLite database at /opt/wadamesh-reports/reports.db is never touched, so a
# redeploy keeps every report.
#
# Usage:
#   WADAMESH_VPS=user@your-vps scripts/deploy-reports.sh
#   WADAMESH_VPS=user@your-vps scripts/deploy-reports.sh --dry-run
#
# The GitHub token is NOT deployed by this script and is not in the repo. It
# lives on the box in /etc/wadamesh-reports.env:
#
#   WADA_GH_TOKEN=<token>             # fine-grained, this repo only, issues: read+write
#   WADA_GH_REPO=ALLFATHER-BV/wadamesh
#
# Without it the service runs normally and simply never publishes to GitHub, so
# reports are still collected and the site still shows them. That is the current
# arrangement on purpose: the matrix lives at wadamesh.com/beta and no token for
# it exists. `publishes:false` from /report/health is expected.
