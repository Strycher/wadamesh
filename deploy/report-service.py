wadamesh beta report service.

Why this exists
---------------
A beta is promoted to stable on a hunch today: it has been out for a while,
nobody shouted, so it ships. There are 13 board images and most of them are in
hands we never hear from, so "nobody shouted" mostly means "nobody with that
board was listening". This service turns that into a checklist: testers report
from the device, per board, per tag, and the promote decision reads off a grid.

Why it is a service at all, rather than the device talking to GitHub
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Two reasons, both hard:

  * The device cannot do TLS. mbedTLS wants ~30 KB of internal heap for a
    handshake and about 5 KB survives Wi-Fi association on the 2 MB boards,
    which is the same reason map tiles come through our own proxy over plain
    HTTP. So the device can only reach a host we control, unencrypted.
  * A GitHub token in a GPL firmware image is a token everybody has. The
    write credential has to live somewhere the public cannot read, which is
    here.

So: device POSTs plain HTTP to firmware.wadamesh.com/report/..., this service
holds the token, and GitHub sees a well-formed matrix instead of raw traffic.

SQLite is the database; GitHub is a view
----------------------------------------
Reports land in SQLite and stay there. The per-tag tracking issue is rendered
from SQLite and rewritten in place, so it can be regenerated at any time and a
GitHub outage loses nothing. Do not read state back out of the issue body.

Bug reports are deliberately NOT here. Those go straight to GitHub as a
prefilled issue form, opened from a QR the device draws, and are submitted by
the reporter's own account: correct attribution, GitHub's own spam controls,
and no token needed. This service only handles the structured test reports and
the opt-in install ping, which have to be one tap on the device to be worth
anything.

Endpoints
---------
    POST /report/test       a tester's verdict for one board on one tag
    POST /report/ping       opt-in "this device is running <tag>" (denominators)
    GET  /report/matrix.json[?tag=beta_84]   the grid, for the site and the device
    GET  /report/health

Run
---
    pip install flask requests
    python3 report-service.py            # listens on 127.0.0.1:5006

Environment
-----------
    WADA_REPORTS_DB    sqlite path         (default /opt/wadamesh-reports/reports.db)
    WADA_FW_ROOT       firmware tree       (default /srv/wadamesh/firmware)
    WADA_GH_TOKEN      GitHub token with issues:write on the repo. Absent = the
                       service runs normally and simply never publishes.
                       DELIBERATELY UNSET (Kaj's call, 2026-09-23): the matrix
                       lives on wadamesh.com/beta only, so no write credential
                       exists for this anywhere. /report/health reporting
                       publishes:false is the expected state, not a fault. The
                       publishing code below stays in place because turning it
                       on later is then one line in /etc/wadamesh-reports.env.
    WADA_GH_REPO       owner/name          (default ALLFATHER-BV/wadamesh)
    WADA_REPORTS_PORT  listen port         (default 5006)
